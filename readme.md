Hi there, I appreciate your interest in my little piece of work!

This is a Google Search Project (0) from CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript (CS50w)
The course is offered by Master David J. Malan and Master Brian Yu. And it is mostly based online.

I did not know how to work with git, and I did want to know how. I was unable to submit the first version of this Project, as soon as I got a little bit comfortable with Git, out of curiosity, I submitted The first version of this project which is considered not as good as this one.

The first version of this Project is not as scalable as this very version.
I went on and on to learn things I must've missed to make sure I update this Project to become responsive accross all platforms.

The first page you would like to browse or open, is the index page. The Index page is capable of performing the "normal" Google search, in other words, it behaves like Google's own search Page. the "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature is not available on devices with smaller screen, but it's available for devices with medium or big screen.

This "web site" is very easy to use, you can easily switch between Image Search, to directly search images, Advanced search, to Google more "precisely" and the normal search, to Google stuffs initially.
